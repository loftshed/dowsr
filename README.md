# **dowsr v. 000001 _alpha_**

## _**dowsr** is named for Dowsing, an ancient practice of divination in which two sticks or metal rods are ostensibly used to find water or other hidden things. It is a responsive web app built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](https://expressjs.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)._

<br>

> ## **Ok, but what does it do?**

**dowsr** is a social mapping platform for cyclists and other denizens of the great outdoors, in the vein of [Waze](https://www.waze.com/). It allows users to create and share map pins with other users, and to find other users' pins on the map.

<br>

> ### _Current features include_:

- Authentication with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a free, open-source identity and authentication service.
- An admin console for managing user-submitted pins.
- User profile creation.
- Pin creation and sharing.
- Search that displays results but doesn't actually do anything :)
- Following & unfollowing of users.
- Upvoting & downvoting pins.
- Custom mapbox theme.

<br>

### Users can keep each other posted about:

> ### 💧 Potable Water Sources
>
> _to keep you from dying of dehydration when you're far from home_

> ### 💩 Toilets, Outhouses, et. al.
>
> _because not every call from nature can be taken standing up_

> ### 🚔 Bylaw Enforcement Operations
>
> _to help you avoid getting expensive tickets for petty offences_

> ### 🚧 Hazards (Closed bridges, roads under construction, etc.)
>
> _to help you avoid an unplanned 100km detour on your afternoon ride_

_potential future additions: bike racks, bikeshare stands, super bad potholes..._

<br>

### For now, just to populate the map, there are also some preloaded pins for:

> ### 🚲 Bike shops
>
> _to help you find a spare tube_

> ### 🏪 Corner Shops
>
> _in case you want some gatorade_

> ### ☕ Cafes
>
> _to keep you awake_
